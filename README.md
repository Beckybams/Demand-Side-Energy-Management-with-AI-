Demand-Side Energy Management with AI
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can optimize energy consumption on the demand side. It uses machine learning to forecast energy usage, detect peak load periods, and recommend optimal load-shifting strategies. The goal is to reduce costs, prevent grid overload, and enhance energy efficiency for homes, industries, and smart grids.

✨ Key Features

🔹 Synthetic energy consumption dataset generation

🔹 Time-series forecasting using machine learning

🔹 Peak demand detection and load-shifting recommendations

🔹 Visualization of usage patterns and predicted loads

🔹 Energy optimization insights powered by AI
